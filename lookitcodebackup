You probably have examples of both in your own household!\n\nAdults tend to think it’s worse to do something bad than it is to fail to do something good. We are interested in whether children also think negative rules are more serious, even when the rules are basically the same - like “don’t lie” versus “tell the truth.” \n\n To find out, in this study we read examples of positive rules to some children, and negative rules to others. Then we asked whether two people could disagree about each rule - and both be right. That lets us measure how universal children think the rule is: is it more like an opinion, or more like a fact?\n\n We will compare answers from children who heard negative vs. positive rules to see if they already see negative rules as more serious. If children treat positive and negative rules equally, that would show that humans learn to treat negative rules as more serious - that adult behavior is a product of experience or our society. But if children already see negative rules as more serious, that would be evidence that human morality really is “based on” avoiding bad actions.\n\n This study will help us better understand the origins of moral reasoning in adults and how factors such as societal norms shape human morality."
